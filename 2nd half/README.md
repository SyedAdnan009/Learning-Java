☕ Learning Java — My Programming Journey

Welcome to my *Java Learning Repository!*  
This repository is a collection of all the Java programs, examples, and notes I’ve created while learning the language step by step.  
It’s my space to practice, explore, and master Java fundamentals through hands-on coding.

🧠 About This Repository

This project serves as a structured record of my Java learning journey — starting from the basics of syntax and data types, moving toward object-oriented programming, exception handling, and real-world problem-solving.  
Each folder contains well-organized Java programs that demonstrate key concepts.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
